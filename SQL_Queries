---------------A. Customer Nodes Exploration---------------------


1.How many unique nodes are there on the Data Bank system --

select count(distinct node_id) as No_Of_Nodes_Available
from customer_nodes;


2.What is the number of nodes per region? --

select region_name,count(distinct node_id) as NoOfNodesPerRegion
from customer_nodes as c
join regions as r on c.region_id=r.region_id
group by region_name ;



3.How many customers are allocated to each region?

select region_name,count(distinct customer_id) as RegionWiseCustomerAllocation
from customer_nodes c join regions r on c.region_id=r.region_id
group by region_name ;



4.How many days on average are customers reallocated to a different node?


select Round(avg(Date_diff),2) as Average_days from 
(SELECT *,Round(datediff(end_date,start_date),2) as Date_diff 
FROM data_bank.customer_nodes) A



-------------------Customer Transactions--------------------



1.What is the unique count and total amount for each transaction type?

SELECT txn_type,sum(txn_amount) as Total_Amount,
count(DISTINCT customer_id) as Transactions
FROM data_bank.customer_transactions group by txn_type;



2.What is the average total historical deposit counts and amounts for all customers?


SELECT customer_id ,Round(avg(txn_amount),2) as Avg_Deposits
,count(*) as Total_Counts_Deposits from 
(SELECT * FROM data_bank.customer_transactions where txn_type= "deposit" ) A
group by customer_id ;




3.For each month - how many Data Bank customers make more than 1 deposit and either 1 purchase 
  or 1 withdrawal in a single month?


SELECT MONTH (txn_date) AS month,
       COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS num_customers
FROM Customer_Transactions
WHERE txn_type = 'deposit' OR txn_type = 'purchase' OR txn_type = 'withdrawal'
GROUP BY month
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN txn_type = 'deposit' THEN customer_id END) > 1
   AND (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN txn_type = 'purchase' 
   OR txn_type = 'withdrawal' THEN customer_id END) > 0)




4.What is the closing balance for each customer at the end of the month?


With CB as
(SELECT *,
case when txn_type ='deposit' then txn_amount*1 else txn_amount*(-1) end 
as Transactions FROM data_bank.customer_transactions)

select Monthname(txn_date) as Month_no,customer_id,sum(Transactions) 
as Closing_Balance from CB group by customer_id,Month_No 
order by Month_NO,customer_id ;




5.What is the percentage of customers who increase their closing balance by more than 5%?


with abc as (
select customer_id ,datepart(month,txn_date) as months,
sum(case when txn_type='deposit' then txn_amount 
else -txn_amount 
end) as balance
from customer_transactions
group by customer_id,datepart(month,txn_date)
order by 1
),
close_bal as (
select *, sum(balance) over(partition by customer_id order by months asc rows between unbounded preceding and current row)
as Closing_balance
from abc
group by customer_id, months, balance

),
prev_bal as (
select *, lag(Closing_balance)over(partition by customer_id order by months) as prev_bal
from close_bal

),
bal_diff as(
select *,
case when Closing_balance>0 and prev_bal>0 then Closing_balance-prev_bal
when Closing_balance<0 and prev_bal<0 then Closing_balance-prev_bal
when Closing_balance<0 and prev_bal>0 then -(-Closing_balance+prev_bal)
when Closing_balance>0 and prev_bal<0 then (Closing_balance-prev_bal)
end as bal_diff
from prev_bal
where Closing_balance > prev_bal 
order by customer_id
),
bal as(
select *,cast (bal_diff*100 /(prev_bal as float)) as bal_prcnt
from bal_diff
)
select round(cast(count(distinct customer_id)*100/(select count(distinct customer_id) from customer_transactions) as float),2)
as prcnt_customer
from bal 
where  bal_prcnt>5 or bal_prcnt<-5
